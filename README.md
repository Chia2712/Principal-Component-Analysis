# Principal-Component-Analysis

In this Repository, you will find the code for using PCA on numeric as well as image datasets. 
If helpful, please star the repository. I put in a lot of hardwork for this assignment.

The numeric dataset I have used is pima-indians-diabetes dataset and the image dataset is the Leeds Butterfly dataset I downloaded from Kaggle.

The speciality of these codes is that the have been executed and programmed without using the in-built PCA function.
